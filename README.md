# LIBFT_FULL

My complete Libft library for 42 Network's Hive Helsinki 🐝

> [!TIP]
> If you're at a 42 school and doing this project: It's genuinely so much better to ask fellow students instead of reading online solutions ✨

## Description

This repo is a combination of my [libft](https://github.com/EvAvKein/libft), [ft_printf](https://github.com/EvAvKein/ft_printf), and [get_next_line](https://github.com/EvAvKein/get_next_line). After passing these projects, we're allowed to use this in any project marked as "Libft authorized"!

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Code was written and tested for Linux (using Hive's Ubuntu iMacs)

- `#include "[path to libft_full.h]"` in your program's header file or relevant C files
- Compile the library by running `make`
- Compile your own program with the `libft_full.a` file created in the previous step
